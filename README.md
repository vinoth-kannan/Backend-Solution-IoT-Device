# Backend-Solution-IoT-Device
A backend solution to manage and process data streams from IoT devices. Use Binary Trees to manage a dynamic set of device data streams. Implement Heap Sort to prioritize data processing based on the deviceâ€™s criticality or data urgency.

**Tech Stack**
In this project I have made use of **Binary Trees** for collecting and storing the real-time data of  dynamic IoT device
After collecting and storing the data in a tree structure, I have used **Heap Sort** to sort and display the data based on the user's preference for sorting criteria
